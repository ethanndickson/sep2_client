\chapter*{Abstract}\label{abstract}
IEEE 2030.5 is a standardised application-layer communications protocol between end user energy devices, and electric utility management systems.
In this thesis, we'll be examining predecessors to the protocol, competing protocols, and existing implementations of the standard.
This report will then analyze how modern programming techniques can be used to produce a safe, secure, robust, reliable, and open-source implementation of an IEEE 2030.5 client library for use in end user energy devices.
