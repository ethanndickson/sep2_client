\chapter{Adoption}\label{ch:adoption}

Further proving that the IEEE 2030.5 protocol is worth implementing is it's adoption by electric utilities and tariffs and guidelines created by government energy bodies mandating it's use.
Consequently, many implementations of the protocol exist already, with the vast majority of them proprietary, or implementing proprietary extensions of the standard.
In this section, we will examine both, and discuss how they may influence our open-source implementation.
