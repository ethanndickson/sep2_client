\chapter{Context}\label{ch:context}

IEEE 2030.5 is but one protocol designed for communication between end user energy devices and electric utilities. 
Although IEEE 2030.5 is a modern protocol, it is not wholly new or original, rather it is the product of historically successful protocols, designed with the same aim.
In this section we'll examine the predecessors to IEEE 2030.5, and their influence on the standard.
