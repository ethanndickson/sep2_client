//! Flow Reservation Function Set
//!
//! This module contains an unimplemented interface for a Flow Reversation schedule, that takes in `FlowReservationResponse`.
//!
//! Unfortunately, it's very unclear how this schedule should operate based off the specification alone, and as such a generic implementation for this client library would be difficult to build.
//! Specifically, it is unclear when `FlowReservationResponseResponses` should be sent to the server, and with what `ResponseStatus` they should contain, as for whatever reason Flow Reservation is not included in Table 27.
//!
//! Regardless, end users of this library could easily implement a version of this scheduler for their specific use case, using the implemented schedulers as a reference.
